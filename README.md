## Authentication 
### Supabase Auth Set-Up 
We used Supabase's React Native authentication guide: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/quickstarts/react-native to implement authentication with our app 

### Supabase Row-Level Security 
We used Supbase's Row Level Security documentation guide: https://supabase.com/docs/guides/database/postgres/row-level-security to create table policies that control who can read and write data in each table based on the user who's logged in.
